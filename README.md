# codered portfolio

This is a [React+TypeScript] project bootstrapped with [`create vite@latest`], website live on <https://codered.dev>.

If you want to clone this project, run `git clone https://github.com/AsherJD-io/codeRED.dev`

## Getting Started

First, download all dependencies in portfolio directory then run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `base.tsx`. The page auto-reloads on file changes.
Any errors during build, appear in `bash`.

## React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules.

You can also install [eslint-plugin-react-x](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-x) and [eslint-plugin-react-dom](https://github.com/Rel1cx/eslint-react/tree/main/packages/plugins/eslint-plugin-react-dom) for React-specific lint rules:
